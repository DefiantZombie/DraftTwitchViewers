FEATURES:

Draft Twitch Viewers (DTV) connects to twitch IRC and joins the player specified channel, and can pick a random channel user, and create a Kerbal in-game
with that viewer's name.

- Easy to use interface, with instructions for starting players/streamers.
- Connect and disconnect, joining any channel, specified in the GUI.
- While getting the channel viewer list, DTV can remove bots specified by the player/streamer.
- Customize the draft message, the already drafted message, and the roster full message.
- Upon attempted draft, a message is sent to the twitch channel and an alert is displayed in-game indicating success or failure.
- Fully compatible with both Crew Manifest and Ship Manifest.
