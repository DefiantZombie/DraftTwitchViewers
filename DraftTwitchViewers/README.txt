Draft Twitch Viewers (DTV) uses web requests to connect to Twitch, and can pick a random user from any channel, and create a Kerbal in-game
with that viewer's name.

- Easy to use interface.
- Draft from any channel, specified in the GUI.
- While getting the channel viewer list, DTV can remove bots specified by the player/streamer and viewers with distasteful names.

- Fully compatible with both Crew Manifest and Ship Manifest.
